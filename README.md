## The Problem

Mental illnesses affect over 48 million individuals yearly, yet over half do not receive necessary treatment. The stigma around mental health makes it hard for those affected to seek help. In times of stress, 71% turn to friends or family, who often feel inadequate in handling conversations about depression, anxiety, or suicide.

## The Solution

Agape offers a way to handle these tough conversations. It analyzes chat logs and suggests emotionally mature responses. Built as a Google Extension using OpenAI's technology, it also features an AWS-powered dashboard for tracking mood and mental health improvements.

## The Inspiration

Our team members have faced situations where friends discussed self-destructive behavior or mental health crises. The need for a proper response to guide them towards care inspired Agape.

## Other Use Cases

Agape also supports post-surgery patients dealing with mental health challenges. It acts as an AI-powered mental health assistant for their loved ones.

## How We Built It

- **Google Extension**: Developed using React.js, it integrates with Chrome and scrapes chat data.
- **Server**: Uses AWS for database management and SQL for data storage.
- **Website**: Created with React.js and Chakra UI, featuring sign-in functionality using Firebase.
- **API Server**: Built with Express, it connects to OpenAI and AWS for data processing and display.

## Challenges

1. **Web Scraping Extension**: Accessing encrypted data and developing a functional Google Extension was complex.
2. **Backend API Development**: Integrating AWS, OpenAI, and our data pipeline was challenging, especially for team members new to cloud technology.

## Accomplishments

## What's Next for Agape
